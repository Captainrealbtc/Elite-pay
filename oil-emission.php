What is oil trading?
Oil trading is the buying and selling of different types of oil and oil-linked assets with the aim of making a profit.
As oil is a finite resource, its price can see massive fluctuations due to supply and demand changes. This volatility
makes it extremely popular among traders.

You can use CFDs to trade on oil’s spot price, or the prices of oil futures or options contracts, without having to own
any actual oil.

There are three ways you can trade oil:
1. What is the oil spot price?
Oil spot prices represent the cost of buying or selling oil immediately, or ‘on the spot’ – instead of at a set date in
the future. While futures prices reflect how much the markets believe oil will be worth when the future expires, spot
prices show how much it is worth right now.

Futures are used by companies to lock in an advantageous price for oil and hedge against adverse price movements.
However, they’re popular among speculative traders too as there is no need to take delivery of barrels of oil – although
you have to fulfil the contract, this can be via a cash settlement.

The two most popular types are Brent Crude and West Texas Intermediate (WTI), which are traded on the Intercontinental
Exchange (ICE) and New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) respectively. They are used as benchmarks for global oil prices,
as well as economic health.

3. What are oil options?
An oil option is similar to a futures contract but there’s no obligation to trade if you don’t want to. They give you
the right to buy or sell an amount of oil at a set price on a set expiry date, but you wouldn’t be obliged to exercise
your option.
Learn what moves the price of oil
The price of oil is primarily moved by the relationship between supply and demand. When there is a demand for oil that
outstrips its supply, the price of oil will rise. But if demand falls and supply floods the market, the price of oil
will fall.

There are a huge number of factors that can impact oil supply and demand, we’ve taken a look at four of the most common
below.
